## Introduction

A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a class label (in classification) or a value (in regression). This implementation focuses on the classification task.

## Features

- Implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm from scratch.
- Support for handling categorical and numerical features.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments for better readability.
- Example usage with a sample dataset.

## Installation

To use this implementation, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Indrani-19/Decision-Tree-algorithm.git
cd Decision-Tree-algorithm
